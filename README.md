#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is used to create, test and maintain softwares. 

Its reliable since it ensures that softwares perform as required without bias and especiaaly for critical apps like healthcare.
It helps to maintain development workflow with maintsining high standards
it ensures that the systam can handle an increase workflow without affecting performance.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning- This is identifying the software purpose and scope.
Analysis- Identifying the final user specifications
designing- creating the frameork to be used
coding- creatind software design to tangible code
testing- examining the software for any bugs or glitches.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology  is Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. There is Low flexibility, changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete, Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed, Testing is done at the end of the development process.
Agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles, High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements, Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint, Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer helps in developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks, maintaining and updating software to keep it functional, collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software, reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement, create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow, confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment, analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient, develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team, discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers,  create blueprint for the project, tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors. An IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing. IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. Example is VSCode. 
Version Control Systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. For example. Git. It Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts, Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification, Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code, Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current. Solution is adopting continuous learning practices to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry.
It's a demanding and time-intensive field thus requires one to work unde rhigh pressure to reach deadlines. solution is to Adopt methodologies to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints.
Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users. Solution is to Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests - are close to the source of an application and they consist in testing individual methods and functions of the components, or modules used by your software. it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, and is  isolated from other components.
 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together. it helps to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
 System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions. It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
Acceptance test- Are formal test that verify if a sysytem satisfies business requirements. They requirethe entire application to be ruuning while it does its test and focusing on replicating user behavior.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the art of creating questions and statenets to get best solutions from AI models. It importance is that it helps to get clear and accurate responses from AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
